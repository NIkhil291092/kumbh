						<b>Kumbh Mela or Kumbha Mela is a major pilgrimage and festival in Hinduism. It is celebrated in a cycle of approximately 12 years at four river-bank pilgrimage sites: the Allahabad (Ganges-Yamuna Sarasvati rivers confluence), Haridwar (Ganges), Nashik 
						(Godavari),and Ujjain (Shipra).The festival is marked by a ritual dip in the waters, but it is also a celebration of community commerce with numerous fairs, education, religious discourses by saints, mass feedings of monks or the poor, and entertainment spectacle. The seekers believe that bathing in these rivers is a means to prāyaścitta (atonement, penance) for past mistakes, and that it cleanses them of their sins. Approximately 50 and 30 million people attended the Allahabad Ardh Kumbh Mela in 2019 and Maha Kumbh Mela in 2013 respectively to bathe in the holy river Ganges, making them the largest peaceful gathering events in the world.

						<p class="m-4">The festivalis traditionally credited to the 8th-century Hindu philosopher and saint Adi Shankara, 
							as a part of his efforts to start major Hindu gatherings for philosophical discussions and debates along with Hindu monasteries across the 
							Indian subcontinent. However, there is no historic literary evidence of these mass pilgrimages called Kumbha Mela prior to the 19th-century. 
							There is sample evidence in historic manuscripts which and inscriptionswhich? of an annual Magha Mela in Hinduism 
							with periodic larger gatherings after 6 or 12 years where pilgrims gathered in massive numbers and where one of the rituals included a sacred dip in
							a river or holy tank. According to Kama MacLean, the socio-political developments during the colonial era and a reaction to the 
							Orientalism led to the rebranding and remobilisation of the ancient Magha Mela as the modern era Kumbh Mela, 
							particularly after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The weeks over which the festival is observed cycles at each 
							site approximately once every 
							years based on the Hindu luni-solar calendar and the relative astrological positions of Jupiter, 
							sun and moon. The gap between Prayag and Haridwar festivals is about 6 years, and both feature a Maha (major) and Ardha (half) Kumbh Melas. 
							The exact years particularly for the Kumbh Melas at Ujjain and Nashik have been a subject of dispute in the 20th-century. 
							The Nashik and Ujjain festivals have been celebrated in the same year or one year apart, typically about 3 years after 
							the Haridwar Kumbh Mela. Elsewhere in many parts of India, similar but smaller community pilgrimage and bathing festivals are called the Magha Mela, 
							Makar Mela or equivalent. For example, in Tamil Nadu, the Magha Mela with water-dip ritual is a festival of antiquity. 
							This festival is held at the Mahamaham tank (near Kaveri river) every 12 years at Kumbakonam, 
							attracts millions of South Indian Hindus and has been described as the Tamil Kumbh Mela.
							Other places where the Magha-Mela or Makar-Mela bathing pilgrimage and fairs have been called Kumbh Mela include Kurukshetra,1718 Sonipat, and Panauti (Nepal).
							The Kumbh Melas have three dates around which the significant majority of pilgrims participate, while the festival itself lasts between one to three months around these dates. Each festival attracts millions, with the largest gathering at the Prayag Kumbh Mela and the second largest at Haridwar. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 60 million Hindus gathered for the Kumbh Mela in 2001. The festival is one of the largest peaceful gatherings in the world, and considered as the "world's largest congregation of religious pilgrims". It has been inscribed on the UNESCO's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The festival is observed over many days, with the day of Amavasya attracting the largest number on a single day. The Kumbh Mela authorities said that the largest one-day attendance at the Kumbh Mela was 30 million on 10 February 2013,2627 and 50 million on 4 February 2019.

								<h5 class="m-4">Mythology</h5>
								<p class="m-4">Many devout Hindus believe that the Kumbh Mela originated in times immemorial and is attested in the Hindu mythology about Samudra manthan (lit. churning of the ocean) found in the Vedic texts.Scholars, in contrast, question these claims as none of the ancient or medieval era texts that mention the Samudra Manthan legend ever link it to a "mela" or festival. According to Giorgio Bonazzoli – a scholar of Sanskrit Puranas, these are anachronistic explanations, an adaptation of early legends to a later practice by a "small circle of adherents" who have sought roots of a highly popular pilgrimage and festival.
									While the Kumbha Mela phrase is not found in the ancient or medieval era texts, numerous chapters and verses in Hindu texts are found about a bathing festival, the sacred junction of rivers Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati at Prayag (in modern Allahabad), and pilgrimage to Prayag. These are in the form of Snana (bathe) ritual and in the form of Prayag Mahatmya (greatness of Prayag, historical tour guides in Sanskrit)
